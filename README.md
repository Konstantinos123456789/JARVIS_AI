### System Requirements
- **OS:** Windows 10/11, Linux, or macOS
- **Python:** 3.8 or higher
- **RAM:** Minimum 8GB (16GB recommended for ML models)
- **Storage:** 5GB free space

### Required System Software
- **Microphone** - For voice input
- **Webcam** - For face detection (optional)
- **Internet Connection** - For web features and API calls

#### Linux
```bash
sudo apt install espeak gnome-calculator gnome-terminal gedit cheese
```

#### macOS
No extra installs needed — uses built-in apps (Calculator, TextEdit, Terminal, FaceTime).

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Konstantinos123456789/JARVIS_AI.git
cd JARVIS_AI
```

### 2. Create Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate    # Windows
source venv/bin/activate # Linux/macOS
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Install NLTK Data
```python
python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('punkt'); nltk.download('vader_lexicon')"
```

### 5. Create Required Directories

Directories are created automatically on first run. If you prefer to create them manually:

```bash
# Windows
mkdir Database Database\Screenshots Database\Notepad Database\NASA Database\NASA\Images Database\MovieLens Database\StockData

# Linux/macOS
mkdir -p Database/Screenshots Database/Notepad Database/NASA/Images Database/MovieLens Database/StockData
```

### 6. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```env
JARVIS_USERNAME=YourName
BOTNAME=Jarvis
NASA_API_KEY=your_nasa_api_key_here
```

Get a free NASA API key from: https://api.nasa.gov/


### 7. Update Personal Information

Edit `knowledge.py` and replace placeholders:
- `YOUR_NAME` - Your actual name
- `YOUR_SURNAME` - Your surname
- `YOUR_AGE` - Your age
- `YOUR_BIRTHDAY` - Your birthday
- `YOUR_LOCATION` - Your city

## Configuration

### Adjusting Voice Settings
Edit `help.py` to change voice properties:
```python
engine.setProperty('rate', 190)    # Speech rate
engine.setProperty('volume', 1.0)  # Volume (0.0 to 1.0)
engine.setProperty('voice', voices[1].id)  # Voice selection (0 or 1)
```

### Adding More Knowledge
Edit `knowledge.py` to add nodes and edges to the knowledge graph:
```python
G.add_node("NodeName", type="Type", attribute="value")
G.add_edge("Node1", "Node2", type="relationship")
```

## Known Issues

1. **Ollama Integration:** The `talk_to_user()` function requires Ollama to be running locally (currently commented out)
2. **Data Classification:** `data.py` needs actual training data
3. **Face Detection:** May not work if Windows camera privacy settings block desktop apps — check Settings → Privacy & Security → Camera → "Allow desktop apps to access your camera"

## Troubleshooting

### "Could not understand" Error
- Check microphone permissions
- Ensure microphone is working and not muted
- Reduce background noise
- Speak clearly and at normal pace

### Import Errors
- Ensure virtual environment is activated
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` again
- Check Python version (3.8+)

### NASA API Errors
- Verify API key in `.env` file
- Check internet connection
- Ensure you haven't exceeded API rate limits

### Face Detection Not Working
- Check webcam permissions
- On Windows: Settings → Privacy & Security → Camera → enable "Allow desktop apps to access your camera"
- On Linux: ensure your user is in the `video` group (`sudo usermod -aG video $USER`)

### Stock Data Not Loading
- yfinance is no longer used — stock data is fetched from Stooq automatically on startup
- Ensure you have an internet connection

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Implement missing helper functions
- [ ] Cloud sync for knowledge graph
- [ ] Multi-language support
- [ ] Integration with smart home devices
- [ ] Mobile app companion
- [ ] Voice customization
- [ ] Advanced gesture controls
